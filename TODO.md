# TODO LIST

## Prove actual version of deposit smart contract
1. functional version using the simple functions with index
    commutation lemma.
    
2.  imperative version of algorithm
    a. use 2 arrays and write a method?
    b. use one array to update in-place.

## Move to using index k instead of path in algorhtms and prove correctness [DONE]


## Re-factoring
[DONE]

 1. merkle definition [DONE]
 2. merkle for a list [DONE]

 ## Finalise

 1. proof that deposit() computes according to spec and preserves Valid()
 2. branch -> left, zero_h -> right and use branch for reverse(left) and zero_h for reverse(right)
 to simplify the indices in the algorithm
 3. README and documentation: update!!!

 ## Misc
 Check the instances cannot be safely inlined.

 ## Refactor
 1. shorten names 
 2. add functional version of algorithm
